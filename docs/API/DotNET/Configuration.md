# .NET API Configuration

### Overview

The .NET API configuration is a crucial part of building robust and maintainable applications. It involves setting up various components, such as routing, dependency injection, middleware, and services, to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

Configuration in .NET is powered by the builder.Configuration property, available via WebApplication.CreateBuilder(). It leverages the IConfiguration interface to access settings from JSON files, environment variables, command-line args, and more.

### Scoping Configuration

Files can be scoped to environments by using the naming convention of `appsettings.{Environment}.json`. For example, you can have `appsettings.Development.json` and `appsettings.Production.json` files to provide different settings for each environment.
This allows you to easily switch between different configurations based on the environment in which your application is running.

This is particularly useful for managing sensitive information, such as connection strings and API keys, which should not be hard-coded in your application.

### Using Configuration in Services

IConfiguration can be injected into services and controllers, allowing you to access configuration settings directly. This is useful for retrieving settings that are specific to a particular service or controller.

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public MyService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public string GetSetting(string key)
    {
        return _configuration[key];
    }
}
```

or in .NET 8+ using primary constructors: 

```csharp
public class MyService(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    public string GetSetting(string key)
    {
        return configuration[key];
    }
}
```
