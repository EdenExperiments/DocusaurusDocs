### .NET API Overview

.NET provides a robust framework for building APIs, offering flexibility and scalability for developers. Below are the two primary approaches to creating APIs in ASP.NET:

#### 1. MVC Pattern
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a traditional and widely-used approach for building APIs. It separates the application into three interconnected components:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Handles the presentation layer.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

This pattern is ideal for applications requiring a structured and testable architecture.

#### 2. Minimal API
Minimal APIs are a lightweight approach introduced in .NET 6. They allow developers to quickly build APIs with minimal setup and boilerplate code. This approach is particularly useful for microservices or small applications.

For more in-depth learning, consider exploring Kevin Dockx's course on Minimal APIs.

Both approaches cater to different needs, enabling developers to choose the one that best fits their project requirements.
