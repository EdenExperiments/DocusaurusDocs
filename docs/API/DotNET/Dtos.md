# Dtos

### Dtos

The Dtos folder contains the data transfer objects (DTOs) used in the API. These DTOs are used to transfer data between the client and server. The DTOs are used to serialize and deserialize data in the API. The DTOs are also used to validate data before it is sent to the server.

Generally, these are used to define the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API. The DTOs are used to define the properties of the data, such as the data type, required fields, and validation rules. They may be similar to the models used in the application, but are much simpler and do not contain any business logic. The DTOs are used to define the data that is sent and received by the API, while the models are used to define the data that is used in the application.

Examples of DTOs include:
- UserDto: Used to transfer user data between the client and server.
- ProductDto: Used to transfer product data between the client and server.
- OrderDto: Used to transfer order data between the client and server.

Code example:
```csharp
public class UserDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```
This DTO defines the structure of the user data that is sent and received by the API. The properties of the DTO are used to define the data that is sent and received by the API, such as the user's ID, name, and email address.
