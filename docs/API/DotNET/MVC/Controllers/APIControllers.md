# API Controllers

### Overview of API Controllers in .NET 8+

API Controllers are a key component of the ASP.NET Core framework, designed to facilitate the development of RESTful services. They provide a structured way to handle HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to build APIs that adhere to standard web protocols.

Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and return appropriate HTTP responses. They are typically decorated with attributes that define routing, such as `[ApiController]` and `[Route]`, which help in mapping requests to the correct action methods.

Information in a controller tells us which type of request is being made, and what the response should be. For example, a GET request to `/api/products` might return a list of products, while a POST request to the same endpoint could create a new product.

Within MVC, API Controllers are specialized controllers that focus on returning data rather than views. They are optimized for handling JSON and XML data formats, making them ideal for building RESTful APIs.

### Key Features of API Controllers

Controllers in ASP.NET Core provide several key features that enhance the development of APIs:

1. **Routing**: Controllers use attribute routing to define how HTTP requests are mapped to action methods. This allows for clean and intuitive URL structures. This is done using the `[Route]` attribute, which specifies the URL pattern for the controller and its actions. Example: `[Route("api/[controller]")]`.
2. **Model Binding**: ASP.NET Core automatically binds incoming request data (e.g., query strings, form data, JSON) to action method parameters. This simplifies the process of extracting data from requests. Example: 
3. **Validation**: API Controllers support model validation, allowing you to enforce rules on incoming data. If validation fails, the framework automatically returns a 400 Bad Request response with validation errors. Example: `[ApiController]` attribute enables automatic model validation. Detailed Example: 
```csharp 
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product product) 
{ 
    if (!ModelState.IsValid) 
    { 
        return BadRequest(ModelState); 
    } 
    // Save product to database
    return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetProduct), new { id = product.Id }, product); 
}
```
4. **Response Formatting**: API Controllers automatically format responses based on the client's request, supporting JSON and XML formats. This is done using content negotiation, which determines the best format based on the `Accept` header in the request. Example: `[Produces("application/json")]` attribute specifies the response format.
