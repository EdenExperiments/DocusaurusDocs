# Overview of MVC in .NET 8+ APIs
### Understanding the MVC Model in .NET 8+ APIs

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a widely used architectural pattern in .NET applications, including APIs. It separates an application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and processing data.
2. **View**: Handles the presentation layer, rendering the user interface or API responses. Typically, this will be in JSON or XML format for APIs.
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes incoming requests, invokes the appropriate business logic, and returns the response.

In .NET 8 and onwards, the MVC framework continues to provide a robust structure for building scalable and maintainable APIs. It is particularly suited for applications requiring complex routing, filters, and middleware integration.
