# UseExceptionHandlerMiddleware

## UseExceptionHandlerMiddleware

The `UseExceptionHandlerMiddleware` is a middleware component in ASP.NET Core that provides a centralized way to handle exceptions that occur during the processing of HTTP requests. It allows you to define a custom error handling logic and return appropriate responses to the client when an unhandled exception occurs.

This middleware is typically used in production environments to ensure that unhandled exceptions do not crash the application and to provide a consistent error response format.

It is used within program.cs like so:

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler("/error"); // Specify the error handling endpoint
```

Additionally, we could use the `AddProblemDetails` method to add support for returning problem details in our ASP.NET Core application. This is particularly useful for APIs that need to provide standardized error responses.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddProblemDetails(options => 
{
    options.CustomizeProblemDetails = ctx => 
    {
        ctx.ProblemDetails.Extensions.Add("customProperty", "customValue");
        ctx.ProblemDetails.Extensions.Add("correlationId", ctx.HttpContext.TraceIdentifier);
        ctx.ProblemDetails.Extensions.Add("Server", Environment.MachineName);
    }
})
```

This example shows how to customize the problem details by adding a custom property to the response. This can be useful for providing additional context or metadata about the error.

There is more information on 'AddProblemDetails' [here](Add%20Problem%20Details.md).
This will be shown in the response body when an error occurs, allowing clients to understand the nature of the error and take appropriate action.
