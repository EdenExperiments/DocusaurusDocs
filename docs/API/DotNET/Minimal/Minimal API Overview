### Minimal API Approach vs. MVC

Starting with .NET 6, Microsoft introduced **Minimal APIs**, a lightweight approach to building APIs. Unlike the traditional MVC model, Minimal APIs focus on simplicity and reduced boilerplate code. Key differences include:

- **Routing**: Minimal APIs use a more concise syntax for defining routes directly in the `Program.cs` file, whereas MVC relies on controllers and attribute-based routing.
- **Structure**: Minimal APIs do not require the separation of concerns into Models, Views, and Controllers, making them ideal for small or microservices-based applications.
- **Performance**: Minimal APIs are optimized for performance, with fewer abstractions and faster startup times.

While MVC is better suited for larger, more complex applications, Minimal APIs are a great choice for lightweight and straightforward API development.
