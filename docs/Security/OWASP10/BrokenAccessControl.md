# Broken Access Control

Broken Access Control or Broken Object Level Authorisation (BOLA) occurs when an API fails to enforce proper permissions for objects within its endpoints. BOLA allows attackers to manipulate object identifiers (such as IDs) to access and modify resources which they should not have access to. This is typically down to inadequate authorisation checks within an API.

For example, an API may allow data retrieval by modifying parameters within a request or directly in a URL such as orderID, or attempting URLs you shouldnâ€™t have access to, but without sufficient checks HTML is supplied regardless.

In 2024 it was reported over 75% of API vulnerabilities were due to inadequate access control. 

## Bad Code C# Example

In an example API, an endpoint for getting reservations for a user only expects a non-encrypted id of the user and no checks are completed, allowing someone to obtain info they shouldn't be changing this ID within the request. 

```
public IActionResult GetReservations(string id) {

    //Fetch reservations for the current user
    var reservations = dbContext.Reservations
        .Where(r => r.UserId == id)
        .ToList();

    return OK(reservations);
}
```

At its worst, someone could brute force this API from 1 until it gets no results and obtain data on all users, resulting in a mass-scale data breach.

It is important to note an endpoint like this might be a POST or DELETE or anything to, accepting just an ID, or an ID and a string/json object, which would result in mass modification or deletion of data. Even with backups, an e-commerce site could lose an entire day's worth of orders or new accounts. Worse, it could damage customer trust and bring on fines.

This is a very simple attack to discover and exploit, so it is important to minimise these.

## Example Script to exploit

```
#!/bin/bash

# File to save the output
output_file="reservations.txt"

# Clear the output file before starting
> "$output_file"

# Loop through IDs 1 to 100
for id in {1..100}; do
  # Fetch the URL and append the output to the file
  url="https://example.com/users/${id}/reservations"
  echo "Fetching data for ID: $id from $url"
  
  # Use curl to access the URL and append the response to the file
  curl -s "$url" >> "$output_file"
  
  # Separate each user's response with a delimiter for readability
  echo -e "\n--- End of ID $id ---\n" >> "$output_file"
done

echo "All data has been saved to $output_file"
```

## How to mitigate Examples

Mitigating these exploits depends on the nature of the application, but in general it is the useage of policies and server-side checks to validate user permissions for each resource. It is best to enforce this as early as possible in the request lifecycle, such as via middleware or framework-level policies.

Another is to not use any predictable ID within the endpoint parameters such as a users UserID, but to use a unique identifier which is a 128-bit number or 36 character string (For Example using NEWID() within a SQL Server backend to create a unique identifier). 

Below goes into further explanation of some additional mitigations

### Checking ids against context set during logins

In the below example, we retrieve the authenticated user ID from the HTTP context, and compare that to the id parameter provided in the request. If these do not match, then we can respond with a Forbidden Status and a message indicating unauthorized access.

Only after these checks do we complete the getting/modification/deletion of any data.

```
public IActionResult GetReservations(string id) {
    string currentUserId = HttpContext.User.Identity.Name; // Assume user ID is retrieved from the authenticated context

    // Ensure the logged-in user is authorized to access this data
    if (currentUserId != id) {
        return Forbid("Unauthorized access");
    }

    // Fetch reservations for the current user
    var reservations = dbContext.Reservations
        .Where(r => r.UserId == currentUserId)
        .ToList();

    return Ok(reservations);
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based access control restricts access based on a persons role within an organisation, and is currently on the main methods for access control within applications.

This is both very efficient, as companies only need to ensure their employees are in their correct role within software, and they should have access to the aspects of software which is needed within their role, and it assists in ensuring that users do not get access to functionality, and data that they should not be getting.|

We can implement this with an Authorize attribute in .NET codebases as seen below, where we only allow a Finanace or HR user to use the SalaryController

```
[Authorize(Roles="Finance,HR")]
public class SalaryController : Controller 
{
    public IActionResult Payslip() => Content("HR || Finance");
}
```

In .NET Codebases we also can create more modular authorisation by applying this attribute to methods

```
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator || Developer")]
public class ControlAllPanelController : Controller 
{
    public IActionResult SetTime() => Content("Administrator || PowerUser");

    [Authorize(Roles="Admministrator")]
    public IActionResult ShutDown() =>  Content("Administator Only");
}
```

## Policy-Based Access Control

Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) is similar to RBAC but differs in that it enforces rules based on contextual conditions, such as time of access, location, or device used, rather than just predefined user roles. PBAC provides more dynamic and fine-grained control over user permissions, making it well-suited for complex security requirements.

For instance, a system might allow a user to view sensitive reports only during business hours and from an approved company device. Unlike RBAC, which assigns permissions based purely on roles, PBAC adapts to dynamic conditions.

This is done by applying policies during startup of a service like below

```
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("OfficeHoursPolicy", policy =>
        policy.RequireAssertion(context =>
        {
            var user = context.User;
            var department = user.FindFirst("Department")?.Value;
            var currentHour = DateTime.UtcNow.Hour;

            return department == "Finance" && currentHour >= 9 && currentHour <= 17;
        }));
});

```

```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("RequireAdministratorRole",
         policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator"));
});

```

Policy based can also be more dynamic, but requires more addition to code than role based and increases complexity
